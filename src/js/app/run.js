/**
 * This file is used to reconfigure parts of the loader at runtime for this application. We've put this extra
 * configuration in a separate file, instead of adding it directly to index.html, because it contains options that
 * can be shared if the application is run on both the client and the server.
 *
 * If you aren't planning on running your app on both the client and the server, you could easily move this
 * configuration into index.html (as a dojoConfig object) if it makes your life easier.
