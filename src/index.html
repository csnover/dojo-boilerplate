    <!-- dojo.js is an AMD-compliant loader script. It accepts configuration either from a data-dojo-config attribute,
         as shown here, from a global dojoConfig object (which must be defined *before* dojo.js is loaded), or from
         a global require object.

         Configuration options for the loader can be viewed at http://docs.dojocampus.org/developer/design/bootstrap
         along with a bunch of additional information about its features.

         Below, we're doing the following:

         1. Enabling the AMD loader. (async: 1)
         2. Fixing the loader to use proper AMD-style baseUrl resolution of unregistered module paths.
            (tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0)
         3. Enabling debugging. (isDebug: 1)

         The remainder of Dojo configuration, as well as our application's instantiation, occurs within
         js/app/_base.js. -->
    <script data-dojo-config="async: 1, tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0, isDebug: 1"
            src="js/dojo/dojo.js" defer></script>

    <!-- Load the application. -->
    <script src="js/boot.js" defer></script>
